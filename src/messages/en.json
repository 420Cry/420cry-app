This index ranges from 0 to 100, where a lower value indicates extreme fear, and a higher value indicates extreme greed. It helps investors understand the emotional state of the market, which can influence buying and selling behaviors. The index provides insights into whether the market may be undervalued (extreme fear) or overvalued (extreme greed).",
